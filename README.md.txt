# IoT Command Control

This project consists of a simple IoT command control system with a Flask server and a client script. The server registers devices, sends commands to them, and receives check-in status from the devices. The client script registers itself with the server, checks in periodically, and executes received commands.

## Features
- Device registration
- Command sending and receiving
- Periodic check-in from devices
- Command execution on devices

## Setup

### Server

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```sh
   cd server
